# ðŸŒŒ Quantum Portfolio Optimizer

This is a Streamlit app that uses a **D-Wave quantum annealer** to solve a basic **portfolio optimization problem** over 5 assets.

---

## ðŸ“ˆ What It Does

- Lets you adjust **risk aversion** via a slider
- Translates a portfolio optimization objective into a **QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization)** problem
- Sends the QUBO to a **D-Wave quantum annealer**
- Outputs the **optimal asset selection** based on return and risk
- Displays **quantum sample energy** (solution quality)

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Python packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Set your D-Wave API token
You must create a free account on [D-Wave Leap](https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap) and set your token:
```bash
export DWAVE_API_TOKEN="your-api-token"
```

### 3. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## ðŸ§  Background

This app demonstrates **quantum-enhanced optimization** using real quantum hardware. It applies a classical finance problem (portfolio optimization) to a modern quantum framework (QUBO solved by annealing).
